API:

2 Options for API Form validation:
    - (One used in this course) Fluent Validation:
        - Install (using nuget) FluentValidation.AspNetCore

    - Data Annotation: A tool to add form validation on the server code:
        - Go to the application folder, and inside the CRUDs you can add a [Required] inside
        the command ctor, above any of the props. (you'll need to use some namespace)

Snippets (USE THIS!):
    - using Snippet generator online you can add snippets which will make your
    life extremely easy

Creates the table:
    - public DbSet<Value> Values { get; set; }

Use to create "data migration" and include "switches"
for Persistence and API:
    - dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Persistence/ -s API/

After this we'll have a new folder called 'Migrations' in
Persistence folder.

If we make any file changes our application automically restarts:
    - cd API/ (only works inside the context of startup project [API in this case])
    - dotnet watch run

Adding CORS
    - add CORS in services in Startup.cs, using addCors()
    - use CORS in configuration in Startup.cs using useCors()

Deleting the database:
    - dotnet ef database drop  -p Persistence/ -s API/
